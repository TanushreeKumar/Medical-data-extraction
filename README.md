# Medical-data-extraction
**Introduction**</br>
Medical data extraction is crucial in healthcare, enabling digitization and analysis of patient information. Advancements in technology necessitate efficient methods, leading to the use of electronic medical databases. These databases offer benefits like improved disease treatments and clinical data for research.</br>

**Problem Statement**</br>
The problem revolves around accurately extracting patient details and advised investigation tests from medical documents like reports and prescriptions. The challenge lies in dealing with variations in document formats, handwriting, and image quality, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies in data extraction.</br>

**Project Description**</br>
The project aims to create an automated system for extracting patient details from medical documents using optical character recognition technology, reducing manual effort and improving data efficiency.</br>

**Methodology**</br>
- pdf2image:- Used to convert pdf to image.
- OpenCv:- Used for computer vision tasks such as image processing, object detection.
- Pytesseract:- Used for optical character recognition (OCR) tasks in Python, enabling the extraction of text from images or scanned documents.
